summary: Talking with your coffee statistics
---

Had a couple of hours to spare and thought it might be fun to use OpenAI to keep track of my coffee purchases. 
I had never worked with the OpenAI API before, so this seemed like a fun project to spent 2-3 hours on.

## The data

I'm using Beanconqueror for the data. I already wrote the parsers for both Beanstats and my website, so it was very quick
to set up. Since the raw data is too much to process, I transferred the data into text and provided instructions to the OpenAI API.

An entry would look like this: `coffee: lord voldemort;3;200;16.2, bean information: colombia;wush wush;natural;huila;null;deiro garcia;null;`.

The values are: name, rating, weight, price, country, variety, processing, region, farm, farmer, elevation.

## The chat

After uploading a Beanconqueror zip file, BeanGPT will create two `system` messages to instruct the OpenAI API. The first message
contains the instruction where I explain the data, the second message is the coffee data. These messages are always sent to the API, but
the frontend filters these messages.

Any subsequent messages are sent as a `user` message, allowing me to chat with my coffee stats üòÑ‚òïÔ∏è.

## The code

Project was set up using T3, using TypeScript and Tailwind. I also included Shadcn's component library.
